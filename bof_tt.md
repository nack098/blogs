Hi, I'm Nakuya. I joined The BMS of Fighters: TT - Sonata for the 20th Ceremony as a member of the "StoryTeller" team.
I'm the person who formed the team which consisted of [Pooh5821](www.youtube.com/@Pooh5821) (Composer), [Hoshiko Hanabi](https://www.youtube.com/@somaoniwa2026) (Composer), [Tawan Sunflower](https://x.com/himawari_hito) (3D Artist) and [Divergent Draco](https://x.com/DivergentDraco) (Illustrator) and this blog post, I will tell my experience.

## The history of me and the BMS

The history of me and BMS competition story is come along with my music composition career. One of the reason that push me to jump in producing music is this exact competition. I came to know this competition back for about 5-6 years ago when I were so into rhythm game. I mean I paid a lot of money on rhythm game and play a lot of them. And that's when I came to know a lot of music in this doujin circle there is a lot of song that's I really like. There is something about the composition that's made me interest in this field. So after learning for quite a while, I came to know this competition and many of the song I really like and many composer that I really respect came from this competition. At that time, I like "Damn, Are there a chance for me to join this competition. I mean it's cool but I don't know how to compose". And this idea has sat with me for quite a long time. But there is one day that I decided to give composition a try. And yes, I'm really into it. Then the idea of joining this competition is not a dream anymore. So, I set the goal as "If I were able to make a music that at least up to BMS standard I will joined." and then after for 2-3 years of composition I decided that it's time I will give it a try.
